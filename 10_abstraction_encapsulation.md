# Module 10: Abstraction and Encapsulation

## Introduction

Both **Abstraction** and **Encapsulation** are fundamental OOP concepts used to model real-world entities as objects in programming. Although they seem similar—both involve hiding details—their intents differ.

- **Abstraction** focuses on showing only relevant information by hiding unnecessary details.
- **Encapsulation** focuses on hiding the internal data from the outside world.

### Learning Outcomes

By the end of this chapter, you will be able to:
- Explain Abstraction in OOP  
- Use Abstract methods in Java  
- Explain Encapsulation  
- Implement Encapsulation in Java  
- Differentiate between Abstraction and Encapsulation  

### Key Terms and Concepts

- **Abstraction:** Managing complexity by hiding unnecessary details from users.  
- **Abstract Class:** A class that cannot be instantiated directly and must be inherited by other classes.  
- **Abstract Method:** A method declared without a body, meant to be implemented by subclasses; used only in abstract classes.  
- **Encapsulation:** Bundling data and methods that operate on that data within a single unit (e.g., a class).  
- **Data Hiding:** Restricting access to class members to protect object integrity and prevent unintended changes.
