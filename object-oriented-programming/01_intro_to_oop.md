# Module 1: Fundamentals of Object-Oriented Programming

## Introduction
Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a modular programming approach that organizes programs by creating partitioned memory areas for both data and functions. These serve as templates for creating copies of modules on demand. OOP integrates structured programming principles with new concepts to overcome limitations of conventional programming.

### Learning Outcomes
By the end of this module, you will be able to:
- Explain conventional, structured, and object-oriented programming concepts.
- Understand key OOP concepts such as Encapsulation, Inheritance, and Polymorphism.
- Discuss benefits and applications of Object-Oriented Programming.

### Key Terms and Concepts

- **Structured Programming:** A precursor to OOP emphasizing top-down design and compositional subsystems for better program clarity and modification.
- **Object-Oriented Paradigm:** A programming model based on "objects" containing data (fields) and code (methods) that interact.
- **Class:** A blueprint that defines the behavior and contents of objects.
- **Object:** A self-contained component with methods and properties that define behavior.
- **Methods:** Procedures associated with a class defining object behavior.
- **Abstraction:** Showing only relevant details, reducing complexity.
- **Encapsulation:** Binding data and functions together, ensuring data safety and hiding.
- **Data Hiding:** Protecting internal object details from outside access.
- **Inheritance and Reusability:** Creating new classes based on existing ones, forming a hierarchy.
- **Polymorphism:** Ability of variables, functions, or objects to take multiple forms.
- **Dynamic Binding:** Linking method calls to code at run-time, enabling flexibility (also called late binding).
